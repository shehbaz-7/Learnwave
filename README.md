<h2><strong>üí° Problem & Solution</strong></h2>

### ‚ú® Problem Statement: The Crisis of Scattered Learning & AI Trust
Students face a major crisis of learning efficiency due to **fragmented and scattered academic content** (PDFs, notes, lectures). Existing AI tools worsen this problem by lacking institutional access and failing to provide **citation-backed proof**, leading to low trust and wasted time. We challenge the standard: learning must be quick, accurate, and completely trustworthy.

### üí° Proposed Solution: The Verified Curriculum-to-Answer Pipeline
LearnWave is a simple, secure, and technologically advanced platform that converts an entire, multi-modal curriculum into a verified, intelligent study partner.

1.  **Content Ingestion:** Teachers upload all academic materials into a **Personalized My Space**, a secure, private cloud (with Google Drive sync).
2.  **AI-Powered Transformation:** Uses **Multi-modal ingestion** (text, OCR, video processing) to transform raw content into intelligent, searchable data using **Flask** and a **FAISS vector database**.
3.  **Citation-Backed Q&A:** Leverages **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and **Google Gemini** to instantly provide accurate, verifiable answers directly from the curriculum, complete with **proper citations**.
4.  **Intelligent Study Tools:** Automatically creates personalized **quizzes, flashcards, and summaries** for highly effective revision.
5.  **Dynamic Learning:** Enhances comprehension by auto-generating **animated explainer videos**.
